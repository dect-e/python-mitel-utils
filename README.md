python-mitel-utils
==================

Some quick-and-dirty utility scripts that utilise the `python-mitel` API
wrapper.

These scripts have been written for very specific use cases and only cleaned up
rudimentarily. Inspect before use, use with caution, think thrice and hard
before using them on a production system. You have been warned.

Their purpose is usually summarised in commit messages and/or file headers,
their commandline options (if any) should be apparent from their use of
`argparse` or `sys.argv`.
